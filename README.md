> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> ### Why I Built This
> Employees at my company frequently forgot to clock in, leading to errors in time tracking and even salary deductions.
>
> - Employees often forgot to clock in, requiring manual adjustments by admins
> - Time tracking was prone to mistakes and salary issues 
> - The login process was slow , Open chrome and login and then press clock-in  
> - Employees had to log in every time they started their system, creating extra effort
>
> This led to inefficiency, increased administrative workload, and a frustrating user experience.
>
