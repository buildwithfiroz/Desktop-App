> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> ### Why I Built This
> Employees at my company frequently forgot to clock in, leading to errors in time tracking and even salary deductions.
>
> - Employees often forgot to clock in, requiring manual adjustments by admins
> - Time tracking was prone to mistakes and salary issues 
> - The login process was slow , Open chrome and login and then press clock-in  
> - Employees had to log in every time they started their system, creating extra effort
>
> This led to inefficiency, increased administrative workload, and a frustrating user experience.
>
> ---
> 
> ### How I Solved the Problem
>
> So I built CRM Login Enhancer ‚Äî a desktop app that:
> - Optimizes login times to ***300-500ms***, making it faster and more efficient
> - Remembers login credentials for seamless access after the first login
> - Runs automatically at system startup, ensuring users are always ready to clock in  
> - Syncs employee data (name, position, etc.) directly from the company‚Äôs CRM AP
>
> It's designed for both tech-savvy employees and non-technical users ‚Äî providing an easy-to-use interface that speeds up login, reduces administrative tasks, and ensures accurate time tracking for everyone
